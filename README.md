GFlows provides a templating mechanism for GitHub Workflows, using Jsonnet. It comprises a CLI tool that can:

* Import existing workflows into GFlow templates.
* Validate GitHub workflows are up to date with their source templates.
* Watch changes to the templates, so you can develop and refactor workflows with instant feedback on your changes.

## Installing

    go get github.com/jbrunton/gflows

## Getting Started

### Adding GFlows to a repository

► First, you'll probably want to run the `init` command to bootstrap GFlows:

    $ gflows init
         create .gflows/workflows/common/steps.libsonnet
         create .gflows/workflows/common/workflows.libsonnet
         create .gflows/workflows/config/git.libsonnet
         create .gflows/workflows/gflows.jsonnet
         create .gflows/config.yml

This generates:

* A workflow called `gflows` defined in `gflows.libsonnet`, which will run against PRs and your main branch to ensure your workflows are kept up to date with their source templates.
* Some common code factored out into libsonnet files in the `config/` and `common/` directories.

► At this point, you should update the `config/git.libsonnet` file to reference the correct name of your main branch.

► Finally, run the `update` command to create the `gflows` workflow:

    $ gflows update
         create .github/workflows/gflows.yml (from .gflows/workflows/gflows.jsonnet)

### Importing existing workflows

► If you want to import your existing workflows, you can use the `import` command:

    $ gflows import
    Found workflow: .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml
      Imported template: .gflows/workflows/my-workflow.jsonnet
    
    Important: imported workflow templates may generate yaml which is ordered differerently from the source. You will need to update the workflows before validation passes.
      ► Run "gflows update" to do this now

► Because Jsonnet (very probably) renders yaml differently from your existing workflow, you'll need to run the `update` command to regenerate your workflows:

    $ gflows update
         update .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml (from .gflows/workflows/my-workflow.jsonnet)

At this point you can commit and push your changes. If you create a PR against your main branch you should see the `gflows` workflow checking your workflows are up to date.

## Validating your workflows

You can validate and verify your workflows with the `check` command:

    $ gflows check
    Checking gflows ... OK
    Checking my-workflow ... OK
    Workflows up to date

By default this command will check, for each workflow:

* That the Jsonnet source is valid.
* That the content of the generated workflow file in .github/workflows is up to date.
* That the workflow is validated by the [github-workflow schema](https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow) from [schemastore.org](https://www.schemastore.org/json/). (Note that this schema is comprehensive but may fail for occasional edge cases. You can disable schema validation on a per workflow basis if need be.)
