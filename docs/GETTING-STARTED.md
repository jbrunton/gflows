# Getting Started

## Installing

    go get github.com/jbrunton/gflows

## Adding GFlows to a repository

First, you'll probably want to run the `init` command to bootstrap GFlows. To use ytt as the templating engine:

    $ gflows init --engine ytt
         create .gflows/workflows/common/steps.lib.yml
         create .gflows/workflows/common/workflows.lib.yml
         create .gflows/workflows/config/git.yml
         create .gflows/workflows/gflows/gflows.yml
         create .gflows/config.yml

(You can also use jsonnet with `gflows init --engine jsonnet`.)

This generates:

* A workflow called `gflows` defined in `gflows.yml`, which will run against PRs and your main branch to ensure your workflows are kept up to date with their source templates.
* Some common code factored out into library files in the `config/` and `common/` directories.
* A `config.yml` file to customize build and validation options (see [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for more details).

At this point, you should update the `config/git.yml` file to reference the correct name of your main branch.

Finally, run the `update` command to create the `gflows` workflow:

    $ gflows update
         create .github/workflows/gflows.yml (from .gflows/workflows/gflows)

## Importing existing workflows

If you want to import your existing workflows, you can use the `import` command:

    $ gflows import
    Found workflow: .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml
      Imported template: .gflows/workflows/my-workflow/my-workflow.yml
    
    Important: imported workflow templates may generate yaml which is ordered differerently from the source. You will need to update the workflows before validation passes.
      â–º Run "gflows update" to do this now

Note that the yaml generated will be a little different from your existing workflow so you'll need to run the `update` command to regenerate your workflows:

    $ gflows update
         update .github/workflows/my-workflow.yml (from .gflows/workflows/my-workflow/my-workflow.yml)

At this point you can commit and push your changes. If you create a PR against your main branch you should see the `gflows` workflow checking your workflows are up to date.

## Validating Workflows

You can validate and verify your workflows with the `check` command:

    $ gflows check
    Checking gflows ... OK
    Checking my-workflow ... OK
    Workflows up to date

By default this command will check, for each workflow:

* That the source templates (jsonnet, ytt) are valid.
* That the content of the generated workflow file in .github/workflows is up to date.
* That the workflow is validated by the [github-workflow schema](https://json.schemastore.org/github-workflow) from [schemastore.org](https://www.schemastore.org/json/). (Note that this schema is comprehensive but may fail for occasional edge cases. You can disable schema validation on a per workflow basis if need be.)

If it fails any of the validation checks, you'll see clear errors describing the problem:

## Refactoring Workflows

GFlows makes it easy to refactor workflows using the chosen template engine. See [REFACTORING](REFACTORING.md) for more.
